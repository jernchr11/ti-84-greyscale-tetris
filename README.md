# Greyscale Tetris
An awesome game of Tetris for the TI-83 and TI-84 calculators that I wrote in 2008. ðŸ™‚

For more info about uploading the game to your calculator, see https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/429/42979.html.

The source code is written in [z80 assembly language](https://tutorials.eeems.ca/ASMin28Days/lesson/toc.html).
